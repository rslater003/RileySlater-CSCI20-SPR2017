//Create a Class called DistanceConverter
//Create Private Variable for inches
//Create default constructor that initializes inches to 0
//Create overloaded constructor that accepts a value for inches then stores it in the private class variable (inches)
//Create Functions for getting each type of distance (Feet, Inches, Yards, Miles)
//with declarations of variables in parameters for each value of the type of distance the function is
//Create Functions for setting each type of distance (Feet, Inches, Yards, Miles)
//Use Equations for conversions to each different types of distances
/*
* Equations are: mile = yards/1760, mile = feet/5280, mile = inches/63360, 
* yards = miles * 1760, yards = feet/3, yards = inches/36
* feet = miles * 5280, feet = yards * 3, feet = inches/12
* inches = miles * 63360, inches = yards * 36, inches = feet * 12

* Create an int main that has inputs for all the program conversions: 1 mile to feet, 
* 1 mile to inches, 1 mile to meters, 1 mile to yards, 16 feet to miles, 20 yards to feet, 
* 100 inches to miles, 1 meter to miles.
